### Task

Lots of fire hydrants cover the entire area of New York City. 
In case of a fire, a fire brigade arrives with N trucks and connects firehoses to the N nearest hydrants in the fire area. 
You need to calculate the total length of firehoses required to extinguish a fire.


#### Assumptions

For simplicity, we assume that a firehose connected to one hydrant is always a straight line between the hydrant's and the fire's location.
    
#### Tips

- You can find Hydrants API documentation from here => https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/5bgh-vtsn
- The direct call to API is `https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/5bgh-vtsn.json`

#### Input

You have to expose an API endpoint accepting the parameters: 
- Coordinates of the fire (any format you prefer)
- Number of fire trucks N
   

#### Output

The API endpoint should return a JSON object containing:
- total firehoses length in meters
- list of N nearest hydrants used by the fire brigade, with its unitId and distance to the fire
   
#### Example outcome from the API
 
```json
{
    "totalFirehosesLength": 1438,
    "hydrants": [
        {
          "unitid": "H325449",
          "distanceToFire": 24
        },        
        {
          "unitid": "H301843",
          "distanceToFire": 414
        },        
        {
          "unitid": "H325111",
          "distanceToFire": 1000
        }
    ] 
}
```
